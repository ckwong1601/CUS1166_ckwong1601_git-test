Sandbox of python classes.
Lists store data such as 196. They can be any type such as <class 'int'>.
It's quite easy to print out lists [[100, 144, 196, 256, 324], ['Snek', 3.141596, False, None]]!

Tuples are immutable. They can have 5 or twenty items, but not 9.66667.
Dictionaries are like maps, but this one is empty.
The ping to Chicago is 60.
Sets are unordered and have no identical elements. This one has 2 elements.
